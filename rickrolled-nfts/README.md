# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Bid with confidence and gift me some Rinkeby's fake ETH to help me deploy more garbage on-chain.
